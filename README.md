irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex
```

- On older Windows builds you may need to run the below command before,  
`[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`  
- The Powershell method does not work on Windows 7. Use the Method 2 - Traditional instead.  
- The URL get.activated.win may be blocked by some DNS services because it is a new domain.
